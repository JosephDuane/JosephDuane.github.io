<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
