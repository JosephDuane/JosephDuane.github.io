<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
