<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a priority.</p>
