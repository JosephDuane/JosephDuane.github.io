<p>In total, the company runs 12 well-staffed security monitoring centers around the country, in addition to 200 local workplaces, guaranteeing that clients are well-attended to.

This means that clients have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year contract, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for a minimum of three years, go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings. However if you may update to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer support experience differs widely depending on the dealer you go with. </p>
