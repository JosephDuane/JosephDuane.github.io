<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular individual reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a clever smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
