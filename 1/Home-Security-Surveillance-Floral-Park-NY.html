<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease criminal offense. The overall cost of a home security system can be determined in three stages: purchase cost, installation expenses, and running costs gradually.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
