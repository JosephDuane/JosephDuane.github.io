<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
