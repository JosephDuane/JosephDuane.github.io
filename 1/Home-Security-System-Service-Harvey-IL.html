<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory.
