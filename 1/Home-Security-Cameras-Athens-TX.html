<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey).

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we don't believe that these problems modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
