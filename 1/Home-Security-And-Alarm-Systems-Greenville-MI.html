Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
