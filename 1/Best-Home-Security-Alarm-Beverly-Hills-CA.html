<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
