<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
