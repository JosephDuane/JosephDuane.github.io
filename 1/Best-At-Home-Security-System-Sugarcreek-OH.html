<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
