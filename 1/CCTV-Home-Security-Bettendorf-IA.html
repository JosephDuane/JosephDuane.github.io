<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my partner).

This suggests that choosing which camera is best for you might depend on how noticeable you want it to be and what it will tape. </p>
