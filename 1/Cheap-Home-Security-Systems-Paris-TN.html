<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
