<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home devices like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks. If you already have a security device from another brand name, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't work with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the same company that monitors the system will install it for you.

Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- watch things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was mixed. Our tester stated the professional provided solid customer care: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some concerns with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
