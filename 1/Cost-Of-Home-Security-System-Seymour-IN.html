<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if needed, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
