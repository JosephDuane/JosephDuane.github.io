<p>Something that must be thought about when setting up CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how wiring will be run throughout the building. In many cases, you'll have the ability to install cameras and electrical wiring merely by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall.

The highest image quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
