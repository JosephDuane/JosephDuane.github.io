For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you imagine a home security camera.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
