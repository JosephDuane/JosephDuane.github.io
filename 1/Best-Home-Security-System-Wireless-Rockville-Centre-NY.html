<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
