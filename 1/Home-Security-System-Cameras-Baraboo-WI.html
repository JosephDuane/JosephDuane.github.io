You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must immediately understand.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical.

With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place.
