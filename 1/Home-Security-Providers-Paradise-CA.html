<p>When picking a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other significant decision. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more resilient and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp.

<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard drives or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a disk drive within it.

It's not totally hidden-- it's easy enough to see if you're looking for it-- however passersby are less likely to observe the Maximus than, say, the Ring Floodlight Webcam.</p>
<p>I explained that all we would need to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
