<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped.

This alternative is typically cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud.
