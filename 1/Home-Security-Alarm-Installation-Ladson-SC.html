<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of technology. For beginners, it looks gorgeous: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey).

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
