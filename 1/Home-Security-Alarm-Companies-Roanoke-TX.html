<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply would not connect.

<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
