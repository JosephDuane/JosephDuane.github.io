So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they automobile restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.
