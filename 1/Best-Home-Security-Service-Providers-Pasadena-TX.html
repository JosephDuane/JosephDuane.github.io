ADT does not list its monitoring and equipment prices online, so you need to hire prior to you have any idea just how much a system may cost. And even then, the cost will change if you include new items on installation day.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
