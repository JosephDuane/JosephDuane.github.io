<p>Put simply, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Combining the advantages of a security camera and an intercom provides you a large range of effective functions to secure your home or business. The videos your camera records most likely won't be saved on the camera itself. The majority of home security cameras utilize cloud services to save and provide remote access to video footage Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to evaluate video, however this is an unusual function.</p>
