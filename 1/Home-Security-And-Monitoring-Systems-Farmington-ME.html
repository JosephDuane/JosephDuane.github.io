<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.

These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.
