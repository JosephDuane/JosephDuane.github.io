In spite of that, the alarm should suffice to frighten burglars for the most part. To recover costs and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to warrant cops response.</p>
