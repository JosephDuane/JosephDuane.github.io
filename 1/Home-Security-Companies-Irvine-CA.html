<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only identifies that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, but it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Possibly more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to immediately know.</p>
<p>When choosing a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera, the other significant choice. Outdoor cameras will frequently be built to be more long lasting and able to survive rain, frost, or damp.

These notices can inform you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the circumstance.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it finds an intruder; a helpful intercom function that enables the gadget to serve as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
