There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, attempt to choose a camera with a fairly wide field of view (seeing angle) and ensure it can catch clear night vision video. Most cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, but there are a few out there that use white light to deliver full-color night video. Search for a camera with a night vision series of a minimum of 30 feet.</p>
