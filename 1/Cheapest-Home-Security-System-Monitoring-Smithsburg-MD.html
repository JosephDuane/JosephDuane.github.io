<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year contract, however because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least three years. But if you may upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
<p>Though we have not evaluated Brinks' equipment ourselves, its sleek touchscreen control board, wireless sensing units, and streamlined app appear appealing. Brinks also uses home automation, which enables you to utilize your system as a center for other smart devices, like automated locks and voice assistants. Brinks provides a variety of third-party integrations to utilize with your home security system consisting of Nest. </p>
