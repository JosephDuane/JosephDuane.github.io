<p>Remote Locations - If an area around your business is remote, chances are unsavory characters are going to pick up on that, making these areas popular for carrying and planning out theft. One typical place is near a dumpster-a worker might throw away the taken items just to recover them later on or send out an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can hinder this activity.</p>
<p>The Canary Flex features an intelligent variation that sends informs directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a variety of features including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway. Not excellent, not dreadful, but with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer feature when it concerns clever cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>

Applications for alarm permits are available at the Police headquarters. Please call the Police Department for an Alarm Authorization Application if you are setting up a new alarm. The alarm company must also be registered by the State of Illinois. </p>
