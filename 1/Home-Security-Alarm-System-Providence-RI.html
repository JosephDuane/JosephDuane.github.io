Numerous top security system companies might also provide environmental sensing units, such as temperature level and humidity sensing units for fire and flood detection, smoke alarm, and carbon monoxide detectors to monitor indoor air quality in real time.</p>
<p>After checking out the comments on this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down.
