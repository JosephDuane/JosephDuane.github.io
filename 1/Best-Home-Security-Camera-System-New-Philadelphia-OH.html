<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally don't featured upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
