We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.

Nevertheless, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
