<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
