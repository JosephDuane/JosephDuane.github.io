<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off).
