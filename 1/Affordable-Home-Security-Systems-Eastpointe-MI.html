<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. Non-traditional networks such as personal network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and must be considered as a security threat. Even barcode readers, portable PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers need to be secured.
