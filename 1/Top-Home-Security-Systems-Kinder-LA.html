The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later.

<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
