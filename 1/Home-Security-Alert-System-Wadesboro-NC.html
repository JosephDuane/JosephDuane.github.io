<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole household will like. But for everybody who enjoys ADT, it appears like there's somebody who's had a terrible experience. Because ADT has more clients than most brands-- which implies it has more opportunities to run into problems, part of that is. However part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment. When a company works with several dealerships and service providers, its consumers are going to get a broad series of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>ADT doesn't have the greatest customer support track record amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this approximately the fact that ADT has a number of million more customers than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations. There's a lot of talk about wireless cameras, but that term can be complicated.

<p>Unmonitored alarm systems: These alarms create a loud sound that is audible both within and outside the home. While they may scare a burglar away, the downside is that no one will be contacted us to pertain to your home, and you will have to call emergency services yourself. Nevertheless, alarm pros say having an unmonitored system is still much better than having no security system at all.</p>
<p>Night vision: A lot of burglaries occur after dark, so this function is almost as essential as motion detection. Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus true night vision based upon image augmentation or thermal vision.
