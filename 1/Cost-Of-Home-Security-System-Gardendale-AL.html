<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
