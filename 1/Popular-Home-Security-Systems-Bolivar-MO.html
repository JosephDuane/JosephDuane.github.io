<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens might breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>A bigger security company that continuously monitors your home will have a designated station that sees thousands of homes and services simultaneously. They cost more since they need to go through verification with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit organization that focuses on testing services and products to make sure optimum dependability and safety. </p>
