<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the specific very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
