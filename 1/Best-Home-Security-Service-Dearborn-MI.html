<p>On the surface area, these two camera classifications may appear similar, though if you were able to see inside, the differences become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being missing or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adapt and catch outstanding low light video.</p>

We serve both commercial and residential customers throughout Southern California. On its face, video surveillance innovation is already prevalent. But beyond the privacy issues of law enforcement's extensive access to historical and real-time video footage lies the risk of it being accessed by malicious hackers.

<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for catching a burglar in the act, however. They're also useful for casual home monitoring. Put on tables, shelves, and counter tops, they enable you to watch on what your pets are doing, know when the kids come home from school, or discover who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. Most even allow you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, by means of an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a little more if you want to include additional functions, like a security camera.

Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast reaction times and general adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and uncomplicated sleek. Otherwise, this company provides a comparable feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why a lot of people are choosing this option. </p>
