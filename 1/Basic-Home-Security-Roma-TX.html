<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Based upon a standard called CP-01-2000, developed by the American National Standards Institute and Security Market Association, the new generation of keypad control panels takes goal at user mistake by structure in additional preventative measures that decrease baseless dispatch of emergency responders.

<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over two months.</p>

With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they've been aimed, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view.
