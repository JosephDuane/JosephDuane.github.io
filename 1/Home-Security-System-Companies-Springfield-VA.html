<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is in between tape-recording and discovering movement.

The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific individual arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

They likewise plan to launch a clever smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
