<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
