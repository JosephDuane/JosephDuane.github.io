When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
