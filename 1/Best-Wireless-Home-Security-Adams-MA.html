<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to add extra features, like a security camera. While a normal contract runs 42 months (one of the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum contract requirement.</p>
<p>We have examined numerous important reasons one ought to think about commercial-grade cameras up until now, nevertheless, we have just skimmed the surface area of the subject. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is seldom a stand-alone system. If your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products, it is worth knowing. </p>
