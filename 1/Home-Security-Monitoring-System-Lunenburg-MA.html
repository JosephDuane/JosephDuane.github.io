The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, night and usage images have always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We've seen it highlight mice, vehicles, and moths.</p>
<p>This Sansco model is an attractive offer.

The app is slick and good, enhancing the camera's own cool style, and you can control the Circle by means of Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop wise home buttons.</p>

The alarm monitoring company will alert the authorities immediately if you don't respond or you state that it wasn't an accident. Various parts of your system will set off different parts of the alarm, which informs the monitoring company what you need - firefighters, cops, or paramedics.</p>
