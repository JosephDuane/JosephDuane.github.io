<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
