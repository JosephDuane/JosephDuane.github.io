We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

I have actually ditched my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has identified burglars or wild animals.
