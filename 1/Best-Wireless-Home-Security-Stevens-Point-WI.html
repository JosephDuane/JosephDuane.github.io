<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
