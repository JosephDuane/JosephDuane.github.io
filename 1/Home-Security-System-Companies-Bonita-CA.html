<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, thermostats, outlets, and locks.

For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, absolutely nothing is recorded.
