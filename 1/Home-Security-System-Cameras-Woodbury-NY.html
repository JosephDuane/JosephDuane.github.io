<p>Nest's home security camera integrates well with numerous other wise home gadgets. Many wireless home security suppliers use door and window sensing units that connect to your control board. You'll immediately be alerted when someone enters your home. Some service providers likewise use glass break sensors to immediately notify you when glass is broken.

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to animals weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can customize the level of sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size. </p>
