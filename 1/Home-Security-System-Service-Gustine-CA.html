<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get fully featured, professional-grade security services that are easy to install and simple to utilize. Wireless Security Systems make use of local disk drive, cloud storage, or a mix of the two in place of video footage utilized by landline systems. Ring video security cameras are high definition, but they are set to tape-record only when motion is detected.

<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
