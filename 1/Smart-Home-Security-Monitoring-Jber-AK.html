<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
