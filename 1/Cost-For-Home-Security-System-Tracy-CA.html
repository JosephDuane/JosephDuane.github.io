<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
