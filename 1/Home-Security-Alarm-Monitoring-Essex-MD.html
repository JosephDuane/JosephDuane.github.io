<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less costly start-up expenses, but may fail if the batteries are not kept. Depending on range and building and construction materials, several wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who lease or who move frequently.
