<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
