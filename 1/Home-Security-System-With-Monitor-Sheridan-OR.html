<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
