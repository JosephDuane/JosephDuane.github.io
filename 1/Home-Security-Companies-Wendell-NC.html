In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
