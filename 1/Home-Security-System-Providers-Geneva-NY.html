<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system relies on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to control your equipment including making it possible for, disabling and sending you instant informs.
