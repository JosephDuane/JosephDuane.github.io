<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Fire sensing units can be separated, indicating that when set off, they will not activate the main alarm network. This is essential when smoke and heat is deliberately produced.

<h3>Security In The Home in Hastings MI</h3>
<p>On the surface area, these two camera categories might appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become apparent and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of available light, and when the lighting ends up being low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins because they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture excellent low light video.</p>
