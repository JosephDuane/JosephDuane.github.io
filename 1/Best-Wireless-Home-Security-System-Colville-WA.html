<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We think that's pricey.</p>
