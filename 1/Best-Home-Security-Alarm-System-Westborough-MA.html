<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically resulting in incorrect alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, offering trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we developed security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the wise home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.
