We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion.
