<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
