<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm needs to be enough to scare away burglars in many cases. To hold and recoup expenses alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you.

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of technology.
