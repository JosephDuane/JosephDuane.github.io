<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. Standard parts in the majority of home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensing unit pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor device.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
