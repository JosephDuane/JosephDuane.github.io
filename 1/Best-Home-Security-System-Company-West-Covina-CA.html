We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
