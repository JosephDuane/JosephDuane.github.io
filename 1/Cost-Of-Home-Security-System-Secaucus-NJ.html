<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not prevented by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the television protection cameras can make sure - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system might offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other significant choice. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more able and long lasting to make it through rain, frost, or damp.
