<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
