<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits.
