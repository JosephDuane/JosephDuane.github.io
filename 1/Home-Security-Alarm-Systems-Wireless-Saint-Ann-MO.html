<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little a problem is between finding and taping motion. It takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it identifies motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording. If a dubious wrongdoer was fast enough, they might get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
