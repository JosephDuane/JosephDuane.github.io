We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
