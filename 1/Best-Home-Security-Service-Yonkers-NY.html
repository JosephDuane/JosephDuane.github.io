<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
