<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
