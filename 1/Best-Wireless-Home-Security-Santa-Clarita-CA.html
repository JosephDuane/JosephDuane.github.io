<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away trespassers in many cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to require authorities response.</p>
