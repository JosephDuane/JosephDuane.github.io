<p>SimpliSafe can not ensure against burglaries or theft, like a lot of home security system providers (other than for ADT). Also, another possible downside, because of their no contract feature, they need you to purchase their equipment upfront. And it is important to understand that SimpliSafe's indoor and outdoor cameras choices are restricted, using just one indoor camera with very little capabilities.
