<p>No power? No concerns. If there is a power failure in the home, Wireless security systems work even. Wired systems can not run when a blackout happens, leaving the home vulnerable. Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.

<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to include extra features, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>Activity notices alert the user whenever considerable activity is found near the camera. Find out if you can get notifications by means of push alerts, text, and or e-mail.
