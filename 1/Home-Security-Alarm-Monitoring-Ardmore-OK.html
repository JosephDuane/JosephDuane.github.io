When implemented correctly, two-way audio is a feature with tons of applications - security and non-security.

<p>The Kasa Camera Outdoor KC200 provides strong security performance and simple installation at an economical price.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. A number of cities also need an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>After checking out the comments on this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down.
