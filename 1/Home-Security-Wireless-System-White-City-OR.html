<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>Home security systems have ended up being an economical amenity for every homeowner, but not everyone desires a system that's monitored by a security company.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
