<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, frequently utilize battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have more economical start-up expenses, but may stop working if the batteries are not kept. Depending on distance and building and construction materials, several wireless repeaters might be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel dependably. A wireless system can be relocated to a new home easily, a benefit for those who rent or who move frequently. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system protects against a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of a web provider. This complete wireless setup is commonly referred to as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software.

However Netatmo has expanded its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a clever smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
