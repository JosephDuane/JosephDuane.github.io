<p>A system that requires a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems normally don't included in advance charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
