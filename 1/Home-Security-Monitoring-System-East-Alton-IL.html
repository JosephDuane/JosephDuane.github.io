<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not included upfront charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
