<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
