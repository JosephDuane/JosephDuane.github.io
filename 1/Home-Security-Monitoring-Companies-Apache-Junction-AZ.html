<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
