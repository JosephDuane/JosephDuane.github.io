While not tops, the 1080p video is records benefits the rate, and most importantly, it comes with totally free cloud storage (up to two hours in total). Because Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app likewise has a connection to Ring's Neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other incidents in your neighborhood, and post videos from your Blink camera.
