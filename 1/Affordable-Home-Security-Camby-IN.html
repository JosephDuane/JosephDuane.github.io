<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
