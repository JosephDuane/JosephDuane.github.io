<p>I described that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
