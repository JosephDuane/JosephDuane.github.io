We have actually seen it highlight moths, vehicles, and mice.</p>

Some systems keep taped video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others provide cloud storage.

Cloud storage makes it simple to store and gain access to recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars per year depending upon your subscription. Some systems cloud both use storage and local storage, and some supply a dedicated storage drive that provides you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, that makes it easy to find a video occasion that happened at a specific time.</p>
