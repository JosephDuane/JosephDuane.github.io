<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The downside? It's really easy to devote security errors that will leave your home vulnerable. The moment you drive out of signal variety or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the minute you've left your house open.
