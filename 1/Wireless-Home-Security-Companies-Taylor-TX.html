<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

IP cameras are the more modern-day model of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a little bit more costly, they provide a variety of features that analog cameras do not.

Cameras let you do everything from look at your animals during the day to see what's making noise outside in the middle of the night. Link Interactive also provides extra sensing units that most security companies don't.
