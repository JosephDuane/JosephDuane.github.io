You can use it even without a Ring alarm system, and if you have a Ring camera, you can publish and share clips of suspicious activity or lost pets.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system.
