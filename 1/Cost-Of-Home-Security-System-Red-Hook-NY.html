<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>

False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
