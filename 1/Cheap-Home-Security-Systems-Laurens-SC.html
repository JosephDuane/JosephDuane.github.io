<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was captured using police databases to gather details on customers of a gay club.

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.

These devices can be installed when you first install your new security system - or at a later date.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
