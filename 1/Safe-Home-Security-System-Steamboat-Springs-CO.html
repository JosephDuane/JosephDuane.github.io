It simply does not add up. To use such low prices, manufacturers must cut corners, and completion outcome is compromised performance.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
