<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
