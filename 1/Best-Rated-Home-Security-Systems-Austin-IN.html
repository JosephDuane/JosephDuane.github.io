<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not link. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the rep asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>

<p>Still, if technology has made us vulnerable, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pressing hard to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera space.

<p>Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since most retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some extra cash while giving a client change, for example), we believe it's more crucial to have top quality images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>However monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, generally one to five years.

Spending for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
