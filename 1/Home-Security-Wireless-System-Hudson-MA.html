<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
