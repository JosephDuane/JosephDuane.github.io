<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it informs the security team and, in some cases, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has revealed that surveillance innovations put in place for one purpose inevitably expand into other usages. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear borders for what CCTV systems must be able to do positions a substantial risk.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something triggers your alarm however you're in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service implies you do not get signaled up until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound might scare off potential trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the cops will not come till you personally call them. </p>
