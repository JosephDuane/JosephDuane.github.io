<p>While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's house owners exist with a lot more options. Wireless technology and home automation features have boosted the strength of home security, while granting consumers unmatched control and customizability over their equipment.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

Arlo Ultra: The Arlo Ultra packs more high-end functions into a single camera than we have actually ever seen before. You'll pay a high cost, but you get 4K video resolution, and built-in lights and sirens in return. </p>
