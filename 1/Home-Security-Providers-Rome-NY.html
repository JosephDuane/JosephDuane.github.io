Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as contacting property owners, notifying authorities, or dispatching private security forces.

Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a car, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
