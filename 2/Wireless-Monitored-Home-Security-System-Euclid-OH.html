It likewise has a USB slot so you can tape your footage directly onto there, which saves you having to deal with the cloud storage system described above.</p>
<p>After testing, we sent out each of our top picks, as well as the Wyze Webcam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of information security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening. (Bill is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec man.")
