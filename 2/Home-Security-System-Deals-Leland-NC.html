<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
