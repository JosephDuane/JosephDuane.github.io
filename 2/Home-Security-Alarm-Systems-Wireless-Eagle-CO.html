<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected intruders or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
