When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
