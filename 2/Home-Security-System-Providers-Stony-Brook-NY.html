<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>

<p>Wireless security systems are becoming significantly popular, thanks to their flexibility when it concerns setting up, upgrading, or moving to a new area.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device informs with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
