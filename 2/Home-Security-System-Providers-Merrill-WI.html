<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
