<h3>Alarm System With Camera For Home in Lithia Springs GA</h3>
<p>These cameras can catching and transmitting very sensitive information," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory.

<p>I explained that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
