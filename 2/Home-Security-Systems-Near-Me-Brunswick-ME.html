<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review.

If you include monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month.

<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) takes place when a hacker has the ability to listen in on network traffic and determine the MAC address of a computer with network privileges Most wireless systems permit some kind of MAC filtering to allow only licensed computer systems with specific MAC IDs to access and make use of the network. However, programs exist that have network smelling" abilities. Combine these programs with other software that allow a computer system to pretend it has any MAC address that the hacker desires, 11 and the hacker can easily get around that obstacle.</p>
<p>The huge perk is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it hardly ever sends out incorrect signals because it tracks your phone (and other member of the family's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will arm itself immediately when everybody has left.</p>
