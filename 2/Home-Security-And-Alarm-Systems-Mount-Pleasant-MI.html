<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Activity notifications inform the user whenever considerable activity is found near the camera. Find out if you can get alerts through push alerts, text messages, and or email.
