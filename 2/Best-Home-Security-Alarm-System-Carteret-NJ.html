However suicide enemies are plainly not hindered by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the restricted advantages that the system may provide in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed expert installation.
