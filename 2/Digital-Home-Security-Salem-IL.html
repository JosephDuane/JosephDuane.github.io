<h3>Top Wireless Alarm Systems in Salem IL</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.
