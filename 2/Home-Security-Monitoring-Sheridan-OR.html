<p>An on-site ringer will normally trigger a bell or siren attached to the building when the alarm is tripped. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a phone conversation is automatically placed to the cops or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is responded to. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
