<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
