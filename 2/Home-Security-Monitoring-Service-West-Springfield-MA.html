We first noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
