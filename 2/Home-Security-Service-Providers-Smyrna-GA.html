<p>The Nest Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the popular Dropcam-- among the very first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up nearly anywhere inside your home.
