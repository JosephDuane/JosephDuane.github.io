<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current recommendation.</p>
