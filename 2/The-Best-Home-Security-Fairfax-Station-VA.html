<p>DITEK's burglar alarm rise protectors guard your security system versus short-term surges that can get in through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. A monitoring expert will call you within 24 hours to discuss your home security requirements. If you're concerned about privacy and would rather not keep your video in the cloud, look for a camera equipped with a microSD card slot so you can keep it locally. A couple of cameras will even let you conserve video to a portable USB or NAS drive, however these devices are rare.</p>
<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
