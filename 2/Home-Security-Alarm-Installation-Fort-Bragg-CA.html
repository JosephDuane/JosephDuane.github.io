<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive enemy, considering that the disruption of the network avoids the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the malicious attacker to tape these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>

When buying a video recorder, you need to first make certain that the device will work with the cameras you've bought.
