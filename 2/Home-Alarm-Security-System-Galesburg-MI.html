If you include monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you dedicate to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 monthly and doesn't need a contract.</p>
