<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
