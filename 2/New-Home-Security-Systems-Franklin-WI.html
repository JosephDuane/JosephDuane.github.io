It's definitely worth a place on our list of the best security cameras 2020, even if there are some problems (the photo quality isn't the strongest we have actually checked, for instance).</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
