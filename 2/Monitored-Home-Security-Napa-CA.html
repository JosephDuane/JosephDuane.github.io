In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
