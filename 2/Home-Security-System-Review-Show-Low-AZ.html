The smart bit is that the camera not just finds that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>
<p>Another reasonable no-monthly-fee alternative is Nest. They offer an easy do-it-yourself security system with technologically-advanced equipment. Nest accommodates both home security and home automation users and is made to combine well with Google Home.
