The smart bit is that the camera not just finds that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>
<p>Another reasonable no-monthly-fee alternative is Nest. They offer an easy do-it-yourself security system with technologically-advanced equipment. Nest accommodates both home security and home automation users and is made to combine well with Google Home. The primary disadvantage with utilizing Nest is that you have to do quite a bit of research to identify what you need.

Nevertheless, Nest does provide high-quality equipment with lots of space to add on and broaden your system as your requirements change. The very best way to discover the best no-monthly-fee security system for your home is to dig in and do your research study.</p>
