<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a certified electrician (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast reaction times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and effortless streamlined. Otherwise, this company offers a comparable feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks.

Given all of the other advantages, it's easy to see why a lot of people are selecting this option. </p>
