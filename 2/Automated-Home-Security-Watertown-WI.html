Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years.
