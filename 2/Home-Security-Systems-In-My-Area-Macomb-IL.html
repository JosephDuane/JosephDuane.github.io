<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
