However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
