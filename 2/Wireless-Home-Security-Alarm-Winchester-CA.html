<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
