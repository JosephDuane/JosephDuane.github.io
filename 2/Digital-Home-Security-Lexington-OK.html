	<meta name="description" content="Good Home Security Systems in Lexington Oklahoma - That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire departmentâ€”so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.">

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrician (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their most recent line of equipment. Both systems offer exceptional, trusted home security.
