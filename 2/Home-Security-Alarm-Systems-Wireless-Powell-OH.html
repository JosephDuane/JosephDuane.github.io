The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.

Having the ability to compare a car and an individual, for example, allows you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
