<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Criminal offense, Cost and Advantages: Public surveillance camera systems can be a cost-efficient method to hinder, document, and minimize criminal activities. For example the cost savings associated with criminal offenses avoided through camera systems in a city of U.S.A. saved over 4 dollars for each dollar invested in the innovation, while another city yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar. </p>
