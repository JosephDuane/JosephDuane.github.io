<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
