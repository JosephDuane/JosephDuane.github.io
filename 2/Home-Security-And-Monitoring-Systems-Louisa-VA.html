<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
