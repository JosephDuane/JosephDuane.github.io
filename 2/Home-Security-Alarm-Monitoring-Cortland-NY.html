<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
