<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
