<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home.
