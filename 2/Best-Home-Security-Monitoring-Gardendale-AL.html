<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
