<p>Composite Video User Interface, or CVI, cameras integrate the best features of both analog and IP cameras. If you have an existing analog system or are simply beginning your video surveillance journey, CVI cameras can be a good compromise between IP and analog.

<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, informs, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
