<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

The alarm monitoring company will notify the authorities right away if you don't react or you state that it wasn't a mishap.
