We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
