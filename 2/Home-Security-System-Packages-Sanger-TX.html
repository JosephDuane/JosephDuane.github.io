<h3>Wireless Home Security Camera Systems in Texas</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>There's a central 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which might be handy if your cameras are all installed outside - and doing so isn't an issue, with each carrying an IP65 rating that means they'll hold up against a jet from a hose. For fixing, you have the choice of either a strong magnetic ball mount or a standard tripod screw.</p>

<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which could be a budget friendly option for consumers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>The home Gateway includes battery backup and a cellular chip which you can activate for $8.00 monthly. Obviously, you do not have to do that; you can use the system totally free. Free of charge you get smartphone notifications, email notifies, an IFTTT integration, integration with Amazon Alexa (Echo, Dot, and so on), Google Assistant (Home, Mini, Max, etc.), Works with Nest, HomeKit (coming quickly), and the ability to arm and disarm your system from anywhere. Home also offers professional monitoring services for $20.00 per month if you do not mind paying.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its 3rd variation, with an easier and more stylish design for both app and gadgets. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller sized, however the range is better, promising connections to wireless sensors up to 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, however we were able to go about 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to locations in the cooking area and dining room. </p>
