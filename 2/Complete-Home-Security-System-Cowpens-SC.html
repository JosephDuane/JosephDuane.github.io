<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings.
