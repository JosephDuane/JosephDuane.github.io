<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
