<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend a minimum of $3 each month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. But if you desire the outright best when it comes to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
<p>Additional functions. A wireless security system is not restricted to a specific quantity of gadgets that can be geared up.

If you include monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly.
