<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
