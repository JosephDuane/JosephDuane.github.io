<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system.

<p>The primary intent of the law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies and their consumers more accountable for false alarms, and decrease the number of unneeded authorities and fire reactions.
