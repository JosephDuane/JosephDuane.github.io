<p>Typically a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the 2 are significantly various. The main difference is that the wired system couple with the other smart home devices to create a network of home security around your home. It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control panel (also known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to couple with other smart devices and can not be managed remotely. Also a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to alert individuals nearby.</p>
