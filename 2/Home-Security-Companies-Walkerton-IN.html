<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has discovered intruders or wild animals. Do you wish to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Security cameras are meant to be discreet devices. Some have protective dome lenses and others have night vision technology.

These parts send out live video to your tablet, pc, or mobile phone so you can check in anytime while on the go. We also bring associated devices, such as cables, extension cords, and microphones to match your security and surveillance experience. </p>
