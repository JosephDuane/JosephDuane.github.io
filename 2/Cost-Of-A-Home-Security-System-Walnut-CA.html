<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
