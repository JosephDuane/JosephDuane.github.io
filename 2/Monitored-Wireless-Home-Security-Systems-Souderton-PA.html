<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which might be a cost effective choice for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

And to be honest, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're spending for is primarily that big name in blue. </p>
