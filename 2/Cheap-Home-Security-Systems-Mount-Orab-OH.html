<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built files offering performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are only 2 alternatives. The very first alternative, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unavailable or reluctant to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to replace and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>A self-monitored system ought to be smart. It must have the capability to follow rules with cause-and-effect relationships in between different devices. For instance, if carbon monoxide is identified, you can produce a rule to turn your heating unit off. Or you can produce another guideline that says if the front door is open, your security camera need to immediately begin tape-recording footage. In doing so, it can possibly protect your home from flooding, fire, or even rapidly altering temperatures.</p>
<p>ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors when it comes to indoor security equipment.

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to pets weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can tailor the sensitivity level based on your pet's size. </p>
