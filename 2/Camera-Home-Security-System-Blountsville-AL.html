<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>A security company will make more money if you choose a professionally set up system. Typically, in this instance, a security company will oftentimes provide you the equipment for free and offer you with a free installation. However, in exchange, they will require you to sign a long-term monitoring arrangement. For that reason, you will need to be going to sign a long-term contract and spend for that service. </p>
