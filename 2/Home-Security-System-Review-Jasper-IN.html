<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
