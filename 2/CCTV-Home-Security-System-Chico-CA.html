<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are created to secure particular, concrete assets, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household heirlooms. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. If the product to which the device has actually been connected is moved or disturbed, the sensing unit will activate an alarm.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with long and normally onerous agreements, and often depend on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and do not suggest for most people.</p>
