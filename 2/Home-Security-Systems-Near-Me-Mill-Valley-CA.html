Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
