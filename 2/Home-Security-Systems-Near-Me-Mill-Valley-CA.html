As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
