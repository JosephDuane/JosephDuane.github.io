The main difference is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home devices to create a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (also known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to pair with other smart devices and can not be managed from another location. Likewise a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to signal individuals close by.</p>
