<p>When purchasing security and surveillance gadgets, there are numerous aspects to consider. First of all, evaluate your situation and find out simply what you require.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.

The cameras should be able to supply you with the needed information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
