<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
