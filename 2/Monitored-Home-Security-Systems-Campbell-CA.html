<p>B.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered.

If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>

We truly enjoyed using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, however keep in mind that it can get pricey if you don't already have a Nest smart home environment set up.
