<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
