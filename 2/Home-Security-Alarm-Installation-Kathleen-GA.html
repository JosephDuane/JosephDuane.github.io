<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
