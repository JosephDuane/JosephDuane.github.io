<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send mobile phone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
