<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>You're in the eye of the public when you're in a public space. So what's the distinction in being enjoyed by a closed circuit TV camera? Even if you were captured picking your nose the authorities aren't going to arrest you for that and no surveillance officer is going to put it on national tv. Yes, a video surveillance camera in public locations is good - it helps in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post criminal offense investigation is simple and capturing offenders is easy for law-enforcement officers. </p>
