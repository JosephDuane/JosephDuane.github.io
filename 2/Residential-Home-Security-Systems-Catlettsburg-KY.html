<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
