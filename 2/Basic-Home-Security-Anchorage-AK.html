<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera Anchorage AK 99504</h3>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
