<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
