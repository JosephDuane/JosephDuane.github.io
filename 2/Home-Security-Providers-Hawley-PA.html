(You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey total per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
