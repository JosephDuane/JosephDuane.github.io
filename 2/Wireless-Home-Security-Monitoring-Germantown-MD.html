When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.
