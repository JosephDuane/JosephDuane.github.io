<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
