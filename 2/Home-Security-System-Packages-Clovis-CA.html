We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
