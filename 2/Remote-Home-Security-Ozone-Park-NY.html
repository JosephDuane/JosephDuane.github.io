<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually found trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
