The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today.

<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much suffices.

The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
