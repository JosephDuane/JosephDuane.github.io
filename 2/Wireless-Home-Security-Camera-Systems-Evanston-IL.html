However neither can record constantly, and they both need the Ring Secure strategy to record recordings. Likewise, the wired version generally left spaces of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips.

<p>Video recording isn't a basic option on many security systems. Homeowners searching for a system that offers video recording ought to ensure the option is offered rather than assume it is.

For longer access to video, expect to pay a month-to-month storage charge.</p>
