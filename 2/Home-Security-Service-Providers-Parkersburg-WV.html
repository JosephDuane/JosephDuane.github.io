In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
