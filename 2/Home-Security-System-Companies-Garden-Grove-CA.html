<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
