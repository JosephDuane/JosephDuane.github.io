<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for capturing a burglar in the act, though. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring. Placed on countertops, tables, and shelves, they enable you to keep an eye on what your pets are doing, understand when the kids get back from school, or discover who's been striking the alcohol cabinet.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
