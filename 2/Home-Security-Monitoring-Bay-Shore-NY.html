When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>One of the top home security providers since going into the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for hundreds of thousands of consumers around the United States and Canada. They offer flexibility in their equipment and offered plans, enabling homeowners to pick the security option that best suits their needs.
