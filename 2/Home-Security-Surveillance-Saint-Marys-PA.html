<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup process. This normally involves finding an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. A number of them then enable you to configure the alert frequency and create activity monitoring zones, so the camera will catch motion just in designated locations-- a function we discover needed for high-traffic locations, which might set off a great deal of false informs.</p>
