<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
