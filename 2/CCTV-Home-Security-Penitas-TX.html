<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>Wired systems use permanence and greater reliability, while wireless systems offer a high level of customization and the ease of mobility.

Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
