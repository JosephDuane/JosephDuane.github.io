We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Wired systems use permanence and greater reliability, while wireless systems offer a high level of customization and the ease of mobility.

Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
