<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in development. We have actually seen enhancements during our brief time with the battery-operated camera, however we simply can't recommend a $200 camera that doesn't provide the capability to zoom video and will not have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

To hold and recover expenses alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to require cops reaction.</p>
