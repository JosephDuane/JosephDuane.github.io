<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
