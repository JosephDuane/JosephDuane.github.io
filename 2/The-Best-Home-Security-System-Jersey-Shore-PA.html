<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera each time. They're excellent for storage facilities.
