<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for additional circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
