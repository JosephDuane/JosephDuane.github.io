<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can select whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is activated. However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
