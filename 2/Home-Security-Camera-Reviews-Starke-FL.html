We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
