<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; everything within their focus ability is captured.
