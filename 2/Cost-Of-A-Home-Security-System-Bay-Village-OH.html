Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and many home security companies use a home automation bundle with an app to from another location control whatever on the system.

Wireless devices interact more securely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>
