Because IP cameras have a wider field of view, too, an IP system can typically deal with fewer less cameras than an analog system.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station. All of the cameras in a provided system require a central video recorder in order to send and archive the video they are recording.

The typical length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some contracts might span as much as 60 months or 5 years. If you want to avoid having to sign an agreement, we would advise thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system instead.</p>

IP cameras are the more modern model of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a bit more expensive, they offer a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences in between the 2 kinds of camera.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
