<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally don't come with in advance costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. But if you want the absolute best when it comes to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
