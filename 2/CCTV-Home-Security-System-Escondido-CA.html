As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
