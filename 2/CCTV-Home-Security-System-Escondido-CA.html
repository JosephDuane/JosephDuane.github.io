<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
