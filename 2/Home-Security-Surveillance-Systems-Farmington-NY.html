<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for each camera you install, including the Nest Hi doorbell.

<p>Think of it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not build up. To provide such low prices, manufacturers should cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in best conditions like bright sunlight?
