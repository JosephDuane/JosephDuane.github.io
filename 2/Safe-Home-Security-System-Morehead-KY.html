<h2>Security & Surveillance Solutions Morehead</h2>
<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings.

Or, if Arlo Pro spots a sound, you can have your lights set to switch on. Unfortunately, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not whatever works as it should; however, the potential is still there.</p>
<p>Recording the video footage from your security cameras needs hard disks or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a tough drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system.
