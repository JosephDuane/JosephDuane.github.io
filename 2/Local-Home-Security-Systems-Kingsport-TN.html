<p>So far so typical. Things start to get really fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
