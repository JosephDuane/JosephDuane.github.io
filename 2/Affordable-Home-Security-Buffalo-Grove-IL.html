<h3>Home Wireless Alarm System in Buffalo Grove IL</h3>

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
