<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off incorrect alarms.

Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
