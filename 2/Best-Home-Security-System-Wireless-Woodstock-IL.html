<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
